# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder tracks durable decisions that govern the GitHub Ralph Loop process and its automation contracts.

## Rules
- If you change the Ralph loop's **process semantics** (labels, locking, worktree discipline, PR lifecycle, logging),
  you must create a new ADR or update an existing one.
- ADRs should be short, factual, and include consequences.
