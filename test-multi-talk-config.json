  "script": "{Southern Girl} Don't talk to me, you piece of shit. I know what you were doing, I'm not dumb.\n{George Wilson} Why are you mad? We had a good time at the wedding, I don't know what you are talking about.\n{Southern Girl} You ignored me all night, you left me alone with people I don't know.\n{George Wilson} You kept going to see the game, I never saw you, I thought you were having fun.\n{Southern Girl} You had fun without me, you ignored me and didn't even dance with me.\n{George Wilson} I asked you to come out on the dance floor, you were too busy watching the Auburn football game.\n{Southern Girl} Well you should have watched it with me, not rub your dick on someone else. You were probably hard.\n{George Wilson} What are you talking about?\n{Southern Girl} I saw you in there dancing with that hussie! Was she better than me? Did she make your dick hard?\n{George Wilson} I wanted to dance and she came up to me, what did you want me to do? I always do what you want, you never do things for me!\n{Southern Girl} I moved to Williamsburg for you, I live in that creepy house with you.\n{George Wilson} Well I quit my job for you! I changed my whole fucking life for you!\n{Southern Girl} I didn't tell you to do that...\n{George Wilson} You didn't have to, you said my job was too dangerous. Now I'm a god damn desk cop. All because of you.\n{Southern Girl} That doesn't give you the right to rub your dick on other girls on the dance floor. Getting hard with other women. Did you cum? I bet you came.\n{George Wilson} Oh you want to accuse me of cheating?\n{George Wilson} I know you fucked John Black!\n{Southern Girl} Nu-uh, not true, no I did not.\n{George Wilson} You at least sucked his dick!\n{Southern Girl} I can't believe I stayed with you after all you've put me through.\n{George Wilson} Well guess what? You're done!\n{George Wilson} She's done!\n{George Wilson} She's fucking done!\n{George Wilson} You're fucking done!\n{Southern Girl} Thank God!",
