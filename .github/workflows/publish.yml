            ## Pocket TTS v0.2.4 (Release Infrastructure Fix)
            
            This release fixes an issue where web assets were missing from the crate package during publish.
            
            ### Key Changes
            - Explicitly included `web/dist` in `pocket-tts-cli` package
            - Synchronized all crate versions to 0.2.4
            - Fixed `server_tests.rs` static asset routing failure
            - Fixed `StreamingMultiheadAttention` for voice cloning prefill
            - Restored numerical parity with reference Python implementation
            - Added web-based UI for live testing
