# Test Data Directory Structure

This directory contains comprehensive test datasets for validating NumPy vs Rust behavioral parity.

## Organization

### `arrays/`
Array creation and basic operation test data
- `small/` - Arrays with 1-10 elements
- `medium/` - Arrays with 100-1000 elements  
- `large/` - Arrays with 10K-100K elements
- `multidimensional/` - 1D through 8D arrays
- `special_shapes/` - Empty arrays, single elements, non-standard shapes

### `mathematical/`
Mathematical operation test data
- `basic_ops/` - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- `trigonometric/` - Sin, cos, tan, and inverse functions
- `exponential/` - Exp, log, power functions
- `statistical/` - Mean, std, var, min, max operations

### `linalg/`
Linear algebra test data
- `matrices/` - Square and rectangular matrices
- `vectors/` - Vector operations and dot products
- `decompositions/` - LU, QR, SVD decomposition matrices
- `eigenvalues/` - Matrices with known eigenvalues

### `fft/`
Signal processing test data
- `signals/` - Various waveform patterns
- `filters/` - Filter response data
- `transforms/` - Known FFT inputs/outputs

### `statistics/`
Statistical distribution test data
- `distributions/` - Normal, uniform, exponential samples
- `sampling/` - Random sampling with different seeds
- `aggregations/` - Reduction operations test data

### `edge_cases/`
Boundary condition and error case test data
- `nan_inf/` - Arrays with NaN and Inf values
- `overflow/` - Near overflow/underflow conditions
- `precision/` - Near machine epsilon values
- `singular/` - Near-singular matrices

### `real_world/`
Application-specific test datasets
- `audio/` - Audio processing samples (various sample rates)
- `image/` - Image processing data (RGB, grayscale)
- `financial/` - Financial time series data
- `time_series/` - Temporal data with trends/seasonality
- `scientific/` - Scientific measurement datasets

## File Formats

Primary format: **Parquet files** (.parquet)
- Efficient cross-language access
- Preserves metadata
- Compressed storage

Secondary format: **NumPy files** (.npy)
- NumPy-specific compatibility
- Direct Python loading

Metadata: **JSON files** (.json)
- Dataset properties and expected behaviors
- Performance baselines
- Tolerance levels

## Usage

Data is organized for both automatic testing and manual exploration:
- Each dataset includes validation metadata
- Cross-language access utilities provided
- Performance baselines for benchmarking

## Generation

Datasets are generated by `scripts/generate_real_world_data.py` and validated by `scripts/validate_test_data.py`.
